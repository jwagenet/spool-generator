# OpenSCAD Spool Generator

The Spool Generator is a tool to procedurally generate custom spools for manufacture by 3D printing. The generated models are two halves of a spool, assembled with threads. A number of spool dimensions may be customized, including the drum diameter, drum width, bore diameter, and flange size. Optional widows may be subtracted from the flange. This first version of the generator is designed for spooling wire, filament, etc., with options for eyelets.

# Instructions

The generator produces two parts, the cap and the body. For compatability, the spool and thread size definitions should remain the same when generating mating parts. Additional window or eyelet customizations may be modified for each part individually.

# Awknowledgements

The threadform customization script is modified from polyScrewThread by aubenc on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796)
