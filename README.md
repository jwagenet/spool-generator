# OpenSCAD Spool Generator

The Spool Generator is a tool to procedurally generate custom spools for manufacture by 3D printing. The generated models are two halves of a spool, assembled with threads. A number of spool dimensions may be customized, including the drum diameter, drum width, bore diameter, and flange size. Optional widows may be subtracted from the flange. This first version of the generator is designed for spooling wire or wire-like medium, with options for eyelets.
